# i18n

All of [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) files placed in the `i18n` folder.

Now, the dream theme has these languages' translations:

- de
- en
- es
- fr
- ja
- pt
- zh

You can replace the translation of strings by yourself.

**Welcome PRs to add new translations!**
